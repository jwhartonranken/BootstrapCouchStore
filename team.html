                <p class="card-text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filipp Chester is a couch enthusiast and has been for the last 30 years. He grew up learning the couch trade from his parents, who were both couchmongers in the LA area. He has built a name for himself in the industry by combining hobby enthusiasts with furniture, designing pieces he believed they would love, such as <i>Vladmirov's Thunderbolt.</i></p>
                <p class="card-text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Filipp is currently looking for his next best piece in the world of tennis, following players such as Novak Djokovic and Serena Williams for inspiration. He plans to reach out to either one or both of them soon for comment and hopes they'll love his pitch as much as he does.</p>

                <p class="card-text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kolton Matthias finds comfort in the discomfort. He takes pride in making designs that challenge the average couch enjoyer and pushes their boundaries to the limits, such as his 2016 piece in which he designed a fabric made entirely of thumbtacks. His pieces may not be made for sitting, but they're always the talk of the party.</p>
                <p class="card-text">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kolton's family at home is rooting for him every day. They have purchased 5 of his couches and placed them around their house, elevating its decor to the max.</p>
